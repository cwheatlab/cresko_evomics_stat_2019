# Since outliers can severly affect normality and homogeneity of variance, methods for detecting disparate observerations are described first.
# The aq.plot( ) function in the mvoutlier package allows you to identfy multivariate outliers by plotting the ordered squared robust Mahalanobis distances 
# of the observations against the empirical distribution function of the MD2i. Input consists of a matrix or data frame. The function produces 4 graphs and returns
# a boolean vector identifying the outliers.

# Detect Outliers in the MTCARS Data
library(mvoutlier)
outliers <- 
  aq.plot(mtcars[c("mpg","disp","hp","drat","wt","qsec")])
outliers # show list of outliers

# Univariate Normality
# You can evaluate the normality of a variable using a Q-Q plot.

# Q-Q Plot for variable MPG 
attach(mtcars)
qqnorm(mpg)
qqline(mpg)

# Significant departures from the line suggest violations of normality.
# You can also perform a Shapiro-Wilk test of normality with the shapiro.test(x) function, 
# where x is a numeric vector. Additional functions for testing normality are available in nortest package.

# Multivariate Normality
# MANOVA assumes multivariate normality. The function mshapiro.test( ) in the mvnormtest package produces the Shapiro-Wilk test for multivariate normality. 
# Input must be a numeric matrix.

# Test Multivariate Normality 
mshapiro.test(M)

# If we have p x 1 multivariate normal random vector x vector
# then the squared Mahalanobis distance between x and Î¼ is going to be chi-square distributed with p degrees of freedom. 
# We can use this fact to construct a Q-Q plot to assess multivariate normality.

# Graphical Assessment of Multivariate Normality
x <- as.matrix(mydata) # n x p numeric matrix
center <- colMeans(x) # centroid
n <- nrow(x); p <- ncol(x); cov <- cov(x); 
d <- mahalanobis(x,center,cov) # distances

# Homogeneity of Variances


# The bartlett.test( ) function provides a parametric K-sample test of the equality of variances. 
# The fligner.test( ) function provides a non-parametric test of the same. In the following examples y is a numeric variable and G is the grouping variable.

# Bartlett Test of Homogeneity of Variances
bartlett.test(y~G, data=mydata)

# Figner-Killeen Test of Homogeneity of Variances
fligner.test(y~G, data=mydata)


# The hovPlot( ) function in the HH package provides a graphic test of homogeneity of variances based on Brown-Forsyth. 
# In the following example, y is numeric and G is a grouping factor. Note that G must be of type factor.

# Homogeneity of Variance Plot
library(HH)
hov(y~G, data=mydata)
hovPlot(y~G,data=mydata)
