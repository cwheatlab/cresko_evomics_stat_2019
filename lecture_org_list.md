		- R is for statistics! Good at stats processes and all the packages available! Derived from S.
		- More upfront intro to R and resources (pull some of these?)
		- Some examples of cool plots (plotly, ggplot)
		- Overview of more advanced applications (perhaps worth mentioning?)
- Rstudio- front-end, nice for beginners, can open .r or .rmd files in there [explore R studio section in separate Rmd]
- Functionality and Rmd- show 'raw' script and putting the code into context- then show that lecture is an Rmd file too!
- Also a variety of outputs and ways to report!
- Intro to basic functions- calculator, creating objects and variables, vectors, creating a dataframe, data structures.
- Importing data: need sample dataset- stickleback?
- Descriptive statistics- mean/var/etc,
- Basic data visualization- plotting
- Sample from normal distribution/randomization/etc
- 20mins lec/ 40mins work

## Lecture 1 | hour 2
- Think more about the dataset w/ stickleback data
		- Different types of data- must be assigned in R
		- Data structure- Bill's figures
		- Observations, replicates, etc
		- True for all data, then this is how R interprets it!
- Indexing and subsetting to subset out from really complex datasets!
    - [] and $
- Tidyverse!
    - Variable manipulation
		- Exercises form Bill's slides
		- tibble/subsetting/manipulate
		- functions in dplyr
		- Tidyverse.R script (Bill add)

## Lecture 1 | hour 3
- ggplot and plotly! (look at Scott's lectures)
		- show and tell
		- provide a LARGE dataset
		- replicate the plots using ggplot

		- Place to work collaboratively
		- Basics of command line git (you can also do this in R studio...)
- Git and GitHub!
